# `DRUM KIT`

Drum Kit is a project which is part of a vanilla javascript in 30 days challenge by **Wes Bos**.

## `How It Works`

Drum Kit is a web application built with javscript(Vanilla Javascript). It returns a musical instrument based on a key pressed on the keyboard. For example, pressing the key **`a`** returns a **clap sound** or pressing the **`d`** key returns a kick sound and so on.

No sound is returned if a key on the keyboard cannot be matched with any audio sound.

## What I learned:

- Using javascript to play an audio sound.
- Adding and removing **animation(transition)** using javascript.

## Challenge:

- I did not encounter any challenge whilst going through this exercise since most of what was covered was basic javascript which i have much knowledge on.
